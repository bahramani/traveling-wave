# Cortical Traveling Waves
> This project is the 4th assignment for the *Advanced Neuroscience* course taught by [Dr. Ali Ghazizadeh](https://www.ghazizadehlab.org/) at Sharif University. 

Its purpose is to investigate some basic properties of local field potential (LFP) signals in cortical areas.
You can find the questions and answers in the [PDF files](https://github.com/bahramani/traveling-wave/tree/main/PDF%20files) included in the repository.

**All the code was written in Matlab**
